This directory will be mounted as a volume in the Docker container setup to
contain SSL certificates for the web server.

If you run dockersetup.py and specify a certificate with --cert and
corresponding key with --key then they will be copied here; alternatively
let the setup script generate a self-signed certificate and key and they
will be written here as well.
