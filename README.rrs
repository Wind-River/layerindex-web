8. In the first run should regenerate Recipe upgrade information,

$ ./scripts/update.py --only-layerindex
$ ./scripts/tools/rrs_maintainer_history.py # can take a lot of time
$ ./scripts/tools/rrs_upgrade_history.py # can take a lot of time

$ ./scripts/tools/rrs_maintainer_history.py
$ ./scripts/update.py
