This is an automated message from the Recipe Reporting System.

Listed below are recipes which need to be upgraded based on the versions
available upstream. If a maintainer believes some of them cannot be upgraded
at this time, they can set RECIPE_NO_UPDATE_REASON in the recipe file(s) as
a reminder of why not.

Example:
RECIPE_NO_UPDATE_REASON = "Version 2.0 is unstable"
