Standalone Setup
----------------

NOTE: The standalone setup is most suitable for development and is not
recommended for production; for production use the Docker-based setup
covered in the main README.

In order to run this application standalone, you will need:

* Python 3.4+
* Django 1.11.x (not compatible with 2.0 or newer)
* RabbitMQ 3.7.x
* For production usage, a web server set up to host Django applications
  (not needed for local-only testing/development)
* A database system supported by Django (SQLite, MariaDB/MySQL, etc.).
* Third-party Django/python modules as detailed by requirements.txt.
  If you're using pip, you can install these by running:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
  (See below for a virtualenv-based setup which is easy to work with.)
* On the machine that will run the backend update script (which does not
  have to be the same machine as the web server, however it does still
  have to have Django installed, have the same or similar configuration
  in settings.py and have access to the database used by the web
  application):
  * Python 2.7.6+ / Python 3.4+ to match with the version of BitBake
    for the OpenEmbedded branch being parsed (for modern versions it's
    Python 3.)
  * Python dependencies as per requirements.txt (we still need Django
    etc. here since we interact with the database through Django's ORM.)

Example virtualenv-based setup for the above:

Python's virtualenv provides an easy way to isolate the python dependencies
of applications such as the layer index. Here's an example of setting up a
virtualenv for the layer index that's particularly useful for development.
(This assumes a Debian-based distribution, adjust accordingly for other
distros).

1. Install required host distro packages (some of these are required by
   pip to build the dependencies; it's also assumed you want MariaDB as
   the database backend):

   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install python3-venv libmariadb-client-lgpl-dev build-essential python3-dev libjpeg-dev libz-dev libfreetype6-dev libssl-dev mariadb-server rabbitmq-server

2. Work around path issues (you may not need this):

   sudo ln -s /usr/bin/mariadb_config /usr/bin/mysql_config

3. Create a Python 3 virtualenv (path can be anywhere you like):

   python3 -m venv /path/to/desired/venv

4. Activate the virtualenv:

   . /path/to/desired/venv/bin/activate

5. Install requirements:

   pip install -r requirements.txt


Setting up MariaDB/MySQL:

Assuming you wish to use MariaDB/MySQL for storing the database - the
following is completely standard, but to save you having to look it up
elsewhere:

1. Start the server:

   sudo /etc/init.d/mysql start

2. Set the root password and secure the database server:

   sudo mysql_secure_installation

3. Create a database (substituting "mydatabase" with desired database
   name):

   mysql -u root -p
   CREATE DATABASE mydatabase CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;


Configuration and running:

1. Edit settings.py to specify a database, EMAIL_HOST, SECRET_KEY and
   other settings specific to your installation. Ensure you set
   LAYER_FETCH_DIR to an absolute path to a location with sufficient
   space for fetching layer repositories. Modify RABBIT_BROKER
   and RABBIT_BACKEND to reflect the settings used by your RabbitMQ
   server.

2. Run the following commands within the layerindex-web directory to
   initialise the database:

   ./manage.py migrate
   ./manage.py createsuperuser

3. You can test the web application locally by setting DEBUG = True in
   settings.py and running the following:

   ./manage.py runserver

   Then visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/layerindex/ with your browser. As
   with all Django applications there is an admin interface available
   at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ also. The initial login and password
   will be those you entered in the step above when creating an admin
   account.

   NOTE: This local server should only be used for testing - for
   production you need to use a proper web server and have DEBUG set
   to False (or use the Docker-based setup).

   3.1. In order to process asynchronous tasks like sending email,
        you will need to run a Celery worker:

        celery -A layerindex.tasks worker --loglevel=info

4. To import layer data from the public instance at layers.openembedded.org
   you can run the following (defaults to the master branch only):

   layerindex/tools/import_layers.py -d https://layers.openembedded.org

   Alternatively you can add layers individually using the separate
   layerindex/tools/import_layer.py script or through the admin interface.


Updating OpenEmbedded data
--------------------------

You will likely want to update the OpenEmbedded layer information on a regular
basis. To do that:

   Incremental update:

       layerindex/update.py

   Reload all data (should only be needed if the database structure has
   changed as part of an upgrade of the application code):

       layerindex/update.py -r
