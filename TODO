TODO:

Bugs
* Directory where bitbake-cookerdaemon.log is placed isn't right (meta dir)
* bitbake-cookerdaemon.log should be cleared out every time
* Duplication of first maintainer when editing to add a second?
* Remote patches in SRC_URI trigger errors
* We're wasting time gathering layer info at the start for layers that have not changed
* import_layer on OE-Core then a layer that depends on core does not work

Features
* Auto-detect dead layers and visually mark
  * Formal deprecation process?
  * Email people when status will change?
* Show other branches when looking at layer - maybe change the focus to show all layers rather than layers at a selected branch? 
* Allow users to make a comment sent to admins/maintainers?
* Marking for recipes with ptest enabled
* Make it easy to update people's email addresses
* Use proper model to store inherits
* Make dependency and inherits list items into search links
* Full-text search on layer contents
* Handle layers that have branch (e.g. master) that is empty
* Add log in again link to logout page.
* Collect interesting news (layer add/delete, recipe add/delete/upgrade) and provide RSS feed
* "Split layer" tool for when a layer is split out of another? (Saves time adding records everywhere)
* All-branch search/results so you can see version availability of recipes in all branches at once?
* Show OE-Classic search results in OE-Core search? (with appropriate disclaimers)
* Display no-results found message when search does not return any results in layer search
* Way to notify in search results when user searches for something that has been renamed / replaced / deprecated?
* Show an alert on recipe page when recipe is outside of layer's BBFILES
* Document macros for URL fields
* Show layer type in layer detail?
* Usage links in list page?
* Subdirs in list page?
* Add comparison to duplicates page
* Create simple script to check for unlisted layer subdirectories in all repos
* Auto-detect more values from github pages?
* Ability for submitters to get email notification about publication?
* Update script could send warnings when parsing layers to maintainers? (optional)
* Click on OE-Classic graph element to go to query?
* Use bar instead of pie graphs for OE-Classic statistics
* Ability for reviewers to comment before publishing a layer?
* Show a note at the top of the layer edit form if there's a validation error
* Show count in duplicates page
* Search on layer selection dialogs
* Close buttons on site-wide messages (using cookie to keep closed ?)


RRS:
* gcc recipes showing up as not updated (we have maintainer links, but not upstream links - gcc-source-${PV} is the actual recipe)
* Make it easier to create release with milestones
* Ability for maintainers to create their own maintenance plans
* Use gitpython instead of shelling out to git to get commits?
* "Last updated" date doesn't show without upstream status data ?
* Try to replace raw SQL?
* Why are we scanning through recipe files? For some scripts, surely just gather Recipe records for the layer?
* Collecting/storing data for every maintainer for every change to the maintainers.inc file is wasteful
* Clean up rrs/tools/common.py
* Handle MAINTAINERS file?
* Need to handle eventual move of RECIPE_MAINTAINER to recipes?
* Change layer update structure so that RRS stuff can plug into it rather than having separate scripts
* We only list recipes that have upgrade info (an earlier design decision) - should we list all?
* Replace "All" with "(all)" and "No maintainer" with "(no maintainer)"?
* Link to upstream changelogs? (will require per-recipe variable)
* Tie into AUH? i.e. display last sent auto recipe upgrade status on recipe detail, add overall AUH status
* Display outstanding patches on recipe detail? (keyword search from patchwork?)
* Record update logs for all scripts
* Sorting by patch count should sort numerically
