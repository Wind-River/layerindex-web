TODO:

- change the behaviour of the filters menus: they should not close on select (they should stay open so that you can check / uncheck multiple checkboxes)

- display a no-results found message when a search does not return any results (all tables)

- we might consider adding a link to the all layers and all recipes tables from the layer details page

* Need an admin contact in footer
* Some columns are a bit crushed
* Description is not formatted nicely on detail page
* Need to show on detail:
 * Last commit date
 * Last update date
* Usage links in list page?
* Style/extend about page
* Style machine list on detail
* Style recipe info page?
* Show recipes from non-software/base layers differently in recipes list
* Avoid page content changing size depending on whether scrollbar is there or not?
* Submit layer form fixes:
 * Layout for deps box
 * Layout for maintainers (js collapse?)
 * Captcha
 * Show unpublished layers in a different style in the dependency list?
* Favicon

Later:
* Provide a delete function for unpublished layers?
* Show count of layers to be reviewed next to review button
* Ability for users to edit existing layers
* Something to help with compatibility (although maybe this should just be handled using the existing versioned layer dependencies in layer.conf)
* Query backend service? i.e. special URL to query information
* Tool for finding/comparing duplicate recipes?
* Tool for editing SUMMARY/DESCRIPTION?
* Dynamic loading/filtering for recipes list
