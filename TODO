TODO:

- change the behaviour of the filters menus: they should not close on select (they should stay open so that you can check / uncheck multiple checkboxes)

- display a no-results found message when a search does not return any results (all tables)

- we might consider adding a link to the all layers and all recipes tables from the layer details page

* Breadcrumbs / fix tab navigation?
* Need an admin contact in footer
* Show recipes from non-software/base layers differently in recipes list
* Submit layer form fixes:
 * Layout for maintainers (js collapse?)
 * Captcha
 * Show unpublished layers in a different style in the dependency list?

Later:
* Allow adding/editing notes
* Usage links in list page?
* Avoid page content changing size depending on whether scrollbar is there or not?
* Style/extend about page?
* Style recipe info page?
* Style machine list on detail
* Provide a delete function for unpublished layers?
* Show count of layers to be reviewed next to review button
* Something to help with compatibility (although maybe this should just be handled using the existing versioned layer dependencies in layer.conf)
* Query backend service? i.e. special URL to query information for external apps/scripts
* Tool for finding/comparing duplicate recipes?
* Tool for editing SUMMARY/DESCRIPTION?
* Dynamic loading/filtering for recipes list
