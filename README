OE Layer Index web interface
============================

This is a small Django-based web application that provides a way to
manage an index of OpenEmbedded metadata layers for use on top of
OE-Core.


Setup
-----

In order to make use of this application you will need:

* Python 3.4+
* Django 1.8.x - tested with 1.8.17; newer versions may work, but
  the application has not been tested with 1.9 or newer.
* RabbitMQ 3.6.x - tested with 3.6.10.
* For production usage, a web server set up to host Django applications
  (not needed for local-only testing)
* A database supported by Django (SQLite, MySQL, etc.). Django takes
  care of creating the database itself, you just need to ensure that the
  database server (if not using SQLite) is configured and running.
* The following third-party Django modules (tested versions listed):
  * django-registration (2.1)
  * django-reversion (1.9.3)
  * django-reversion-compare (0.5.6)
  * django-simple-captcha (0.4.6)
  * django-nvd3 (0.14.2)
  * djangorestframework (3.2.5)
  * django-cors-headers (1.1.0)
* On the machine that will run the backend update script (which does not
  have to be the same machine as the web server, however it does still
  have to have Django installed, have the same or similar configuration
  in settings.py and have access to the database used by the web
  application):
  * Python 2.7.6+ / Python 3.4+ to match with the version of BitBake
    for the OpenEmbedded branch being parsed
  * GitPython (python-git) version 2.0 or later

Setup instructions:

1. Edit settings.py to specify a database, EMAIL_HOST, SECRET_KEY and
   other settings specific to your installation. Ensure you set
   LAYER_FETCH_DIR to an absolute path to a location with sufficient
   space for fetching layer repositories. Modify RABBIT_BROKER
   and RABBIT_BACKEND to reflect the settings used by your RabbitMQ
   server.

2. Run the following commands within the layerindex-web directory to
   initialise the database:

   python3 manage.py migrate
   python3 manage.py createsuperuser

3. You can test the web application locally by setting DEBUG = True in
   settings.py and running the following:

   python3 manage.py runserver

   Then visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/layerindex/ with your browser. As
   with all Django applications there is an admin interface available
   at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ also. The initial login and password
   will be those you entered in the step above when creating an admin
   account.

   NOTE: This local server should only be used for testing - for
   production you need to use a proper web server and have DEBUG set
   to False.

   3.1. In order to process asynchronous tasks like sending email,
        you will need to run a Celery worker:

        celery -A layerindex.tasks worker --loglevel=info

4. You'll need to add at least the openembedded-core layer to the
   database, or some equivalent that contains conf/bitbake.conf for
   the base system configuration. To add this, follow these steps:

   4.1. With the server running, go to the main page (see above) and
        click on the "Log in" button on the top right. Use the
        login/password you added in step 2 above.

   4.2. Click on the "Submit Layer" button in the top right and
        enter the details for the core layer. To use the real
        openembedded-core layer, use these values:

        Layer name:               openembedded-core
        Layer type:               Base
        Summary:                  Core metadata
        Description:              Core metadata
        Repository URL:           git://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core
        Repository subdirectory:  meta

        Once you have filled in the required values, click on the
        "Submit Layer" button.

        NOTE: The name of the layer must be "openembedded-core",
        unless you change CORE_LAYER_NAME in settings.py to match
        whatever alternative name you use here.

   4.3. The layer has been added but is not yet published. (For the
        public index this provides some protection against spam and
        malformed entries.) To publish it, click on the orange number
        next to your login name at the top right, click on the
        newly added layer entry, and then click on "Publish Layer".

5. If you need to support multiple branches of OpenEmbedded/BitBake
   where some require Python 2.x and others require Python 3.x, then
   you will need to set up "Python environment" records through the
   admin interface to correspond to these so that the right Python
   version gets used to parse the branch, and then set the
   "Update environment" field on each branch record to point to the
   appropriate environment. If you're using virtualenv you will need
   separate virtual environments set up for Python 2 and 3 which you
   should point to in the Python environment record.

6. Set the site name (as displayed in the top bar and page titles) by
   going into the admin interface (http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/),
   clicking on "Sites" at the bottom, and editing the first entry,
   setting "Display name" to the desired name.

7. You may wish to customise some of the page templates to suit your
   installation, in particular:
   * templates/base.html
   * templates/layerindex/about.html

8. To use layerindex-web with Docker containers, refer to docker/README
   keeping in mind you'll need to set up Docker properly as part of the
   setup process.


Usage
-----

On a regular basis you need to run the update script:

path/to/layerindex/update.py

This will fetch all of the layer repositories, analyse their contents
and update the database with the results. Run the script with --help for
further information on available options.


Upgrading from an earlier version
---------------------------------

This application uses Django's migrations functionality to allow changes
in the database structure whilst preserving existing data. When upgrading
with an existing database, you just need to invoke the migration command.

If you're migrating from a version prior to the Django 1.8 upgrade, you
need to use the following command so that the initial migration (which
takes care of creating the database structure and initial data) is
skipped:

python3 manage.py migrate --fake-initial

Otherwise, you can just run the plain migration command:

python3 manage.py migrate


Support for OE-Classic
----------------------

The Layer index optionally provides a means to index OE-Classic on a
one-off import basis and then compare what was there to what you have
now in the indexed layers (with some graphs showing how much of it has
been migrated/superseded). If you want to enable this, do the following:

1. From the admin interface, create a Branch record with the following
   values:
     - Name: oe-classic
     - Bitbake branch: 1.12
     - Enable updates: NOT enabled
     - Update environment: if you have set up Python environments (for
       python2 vs python3 across different branches) then you'll need
       to select the python2 environment that you created here

2. Clone OE-Classic somewhere locally on the machine running the
   layer index:

   git clone git://git.openembedded.org/openembedded

3. Clone a bitbake somewhere locally and check out the 1.12 branch:

   git clone git://git.openembedded.org/bitbake -b 1.12

4. Run import_classic.py, specifying the path to OE-Classic and
   the bitbake you checked out:

   layerindex/tools/import_classic.py /path/to/bitbake112 /path/to/oeclassic

5. Update the migration status of OE-Classic recipes based on other
   layers in the database:

   layerindex/tools/update_classic_status.py

If you refresh the main page of the website, the OE-Classic data should
now show up at the bottom of the branch drop-down menu. On a periodic
basis you can repeat the last step to update the migration status in case
new recipes are brought across (or replacements are created). Users with
sufficient permissions can also manually update the migration status on
the OE-Classic recipe detail pages within the website, which is useful
for example when there's a replacement recipe in another layer that
doesn't have the same name, so the update_classic_status.py script
wouldn't be able to pick it up.
